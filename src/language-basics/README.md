# language-basics — Quick Guide

This folder contains focused TypeScript examples and small exercises that demonstrate core language concepts. Each subfolder is intentionally small and self-contained so you can open, run, and read examples quickly.

## Structure
- syntax/ — Basic syntax: let/const, operators, comments, type annotations.
- types/ — Primitive types, unions, tuples, literal types, type aliases.
- functions/ — Function declarations, expressions, overloads, callbacks, arrow functions.
- control-flow/ — if/else, switch, loops, type guards, exhaustive checks.
- collections/ — Arrays, ReadonlyArray, Map, Set, tuple usage patterns.
- oop/ — Classes, interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, visibility modifiers.
- generics/ — Generic functions, generic classes, constraints, utility types.
- modules/ — import/export patterns, default vs named exports, aliasing.
- async/ — Promises, async/await, basic concurrency patterns, cancellation notes.
- utils/ — Small helpers used across examples (formatters, printers, small mocks).

## Contributing
- Keep changes small and topic-focused.
- Add or update an example with a short comment header explaining intent.

## Notes
- Examples favor clarity over performance.
- Avoid external dependencies unless illustrating specific APIs.

Use this README as an index. Open the folder you’re interested in and run a single file to explore the concept quickly.
